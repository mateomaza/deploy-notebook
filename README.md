## Features

Phase 1: Note Creation
Users can create, edit, and delete notes.
Users can archive and unarchive notes, with separate listings for active and archived notes.

Phase 2: Tag Application and Filtering
Users can add or remove tags (categories) to notes.
Users can filter notes based on these tags.

Extra Features
Authentication: A mock login mechanism is implemented. Decided that a realistic login would be overengineering.
